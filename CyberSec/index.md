# CyberSec {#cybersec}

## Introduction {#introduction}

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

## Cybersecurity Fundamentals {#fundamentals}

Cybersecurity is essential for protecting your digital assets. Here are some fundamental concepts to understand:
 - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that data is only accessible to authorized users.
 - **Integrity**: Protecting data from unauthorized changes.
 - **Availability**: Ensuring that data is available when needed.
 - **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or systems.
 - **Authorization**: Granting access to users based on their identity.
 - **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring that a user cannot deny performing an action.
 - **Privacy**: Protecting personal information from unauthorized access.
 - **Resilience**: The ability to recover from cyberattacks and continue operations.
 - **Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to digital assets.
 - **Compliance**: Adhering to laws, regulations, and industry standards.
 - **Incident Response**: Preparing for and responding to cybersecurity incidents.
 - **Security Awareness**: Educating users about cybersecurity best practices.
 - **Threat Intelligence**: Monitoring and analyzing threats to prevent cyberattacks.
 - **Security Operations**: Managing security tools, processes, and policies.
 - **Vulnerability Management**: Identifying and patching security vulnerabilities.
 - **Penetration Testing**: Testing systems for security weaknesses.
 - **Security Auditing**: Evaluating security controls and practices.
 - **Security Architecture**: Designing secure systems and networks.
 - **Security Policies**: Establishing rules and guidelines for cybersecurity.
 - **Security Controls**: Implementing safeguards to protect digital assets.
 - **Security Monitoring**: Detecting and responding to security incidents.
 - **Security Incident Management**: Handling cybersecurity incidents effectively.
 - **Security Governance**: Overseeing cybersecurity strategy and operations.

## Cybersecurity Domains {#domains}

- **Network Security**: Protecting networks from unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
- **Application Security**: Securing software applications from vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Cloud Security**: Ensuring the security of cloud-based services and data.
- **Endpoint Security**: Protecting devices like computers, smartphones, and IoT devices.
- **Data Security**: Safeguarding data from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Managing user identities and access rights.
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: Monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents.
- **Incident Response (IR)**: Preparing for and responding to cybersecurity incidents.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Gathering, analyzing, and sharing information about cyber threats.
- **Security Awareness Training**: Educating users about cybersecurity risks and best practices.
- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**: Managing cybersecurity risks and compliance requirements.
- **Cryptographic Security**: Using encryption to protect data confidentiality and integrity.
- **Mobile Security**: Securing mobile devices and applications from cyber threats.

## Cybersecurity Tools {#tools}

<!-- lexic words like IPS, IDS ... -->

 - **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: A security tool that monitors network traffic to detect and prevent cyberattacks.
 - **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: A security tool that analyzes network traffic for signs of cyberattacks.
 - **Firewall**: A security tool that filters network traffic to block unauthorized access.
 - **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: A security tool that collects and analyzes security data from various sources.
 - **Antivirus Software**: A security tool that detects and removes malware from systems.
 - **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A secure network connection that encrypts data for privacy.
 - **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: A security tool that filters and monitors web traffic to protect applications.
 - **DLP (Data Loss Prevention)**: A security tool that prevents unauthorized data leaks.
 - **HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System)**: A security tool that monitors system activities for signs of cyberattacks.
 - **NIDS (Network-based Intrusion Detection System)**: A security tool that analyzes network traffic for signs of cyberattacks.
