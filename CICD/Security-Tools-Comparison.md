# DevSecOps Security Tools Comparison

This guide helps you select the right security tools for your DevSecOps pipeline by comparing popular options and providing implementation difficulty ratings.

## Container Security Scanners

Container security scanners help you identify vulnerabilities in your container images.

<DifficultyIndicator :difficulty="2" label="Container Security Scanning" time="1-2 hours" :prerequisites="['Docker basics']">
  Setting up basic container scanning is relatively straightforward with modern tools. Most scanners can be integrated directly into CI/CD pipelines with minimal configuration.

#### Implementing Trivy Scanner

<DifficultyIndicator :difficulty="2" label="Trivy Integration" time="30-60 minutes" :prerequisites="['Docker', 'Basic CI/CD knowledge']">
  Trivy is one of the easiest container scanners to implement with excellent documentation and simple integration patterns.
</DifficultyIndicator>

```bash
# Basic usage
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock aquasec/trivy image alpine:latest

# CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions example)
trivy-action@master:
  with:
    image-ref: 'your-image:tag'
    format: 'sarif'
    output: 'trivy-results.sarif'
```

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

SAST tools analyze source code to identify security vulnerabilities without executing the application.

<DifficultyIndicator :difficulty="3" label="SAST Implementation" time="1-3 days" :prerequisites="['CI/CD pipeline', 'Code repository access']">
  Setting up SAST requires more configuration than container scanning. You'll need to configure the tools for your specific programming languages and integrate results into your development workflow.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security

<DifficultyIndicator :difficulty="4" label="IaC Security Scanning" time="2-5 days" :prerequisites="['Terraform/CloudFormation', 'CI/CD pipeline']">
  Implementing IaC security scanning requires understanding of infrastructure code, compliance requirements, and proper remediation workflows.
