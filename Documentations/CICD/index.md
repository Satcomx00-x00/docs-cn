# CI/CD - Continuous Integration and Deployment

## Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential DevSecOps practices that enable automation of the development, testing, and deployment process of applications.

## Covered CI/CD Tools

### Continuous Integration

- **[GitHub Actions](/Documentations/CICD/Github-CI)** - GitHub's native CI/CD platform with event-driven workflows
- **[GitLab CI](/Documentations/CICD/GitLab-CI)** - GitLab's integrated CI/CD solution with pipelines as code

### Continuous Deployment

<!-- - **[Docker Registry](/CICD/Docker-Registry)** - Container image management and storage -->
<!-- - **[Automated Deployment](/CICD/Automated-Deployment)** - Automated deployment strategies -->

*Additional deployment guides coming soon...*

## Fundamental Principles

1. **Automation** - Reduce manual interventions
2. **Fast Feedback** - Early problem detection
3. **Frequent Deployments** - Small and regular deliveries
4. **Quality** - Automated testing at every stage
5. **Security** - Integration of security controls

## CI/CD Benefits

- Reduced deployment risks
- Improved code quality
- Faster time-to-market
- Better team collaboration
- Visibility into the development process
