## Introduction to Terraform

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud and on-premises resources using a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

- **Declarative Approach:** Describe your desired infrastructure state, and Terraform handles the provisioning and updates.
- **Provider Ecosystem:** Supports major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and many other services.
- **State Management:** Maintains the state of your infrastructure, enabling safe updates and collaboration.
- **Modular Design:** Encourages reuse and sharing of infrastructure code through modules.

::: tip
Terraform is widely used for automating infrastructure deployment, reducing manual errors, and enabling version control for infrastructure changes.
